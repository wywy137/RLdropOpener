# RLdropOpener
An AutoHotkey script to automatically open a stack of crates/drops in Rocket League.
 
Download and install AutoHotkey from their website: https://www.autohotkey.com/

Right click the .ahk file and click "edit script"

Set "numCrates" to the number of drops to open. 
(ie if you have 20 crates to open, that line should look something like "numCrates = 20")

Run the script (double click the .ahk or right click it -> run script) then pull up the stack of drops in your inventory

Once you're on the page where it shows you the possible items in the drop, press the ENTER key and it should start opening them.

The script will close after however many loops you set numCrates equal to.
Alternatively, hit ESC to end the script at any time.
